<h1>Discussion on data structure behind repositor(ies)<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion-on-data-structure-behind-repositor-ies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>I hope this is a short discussion on the issues raised recently.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-basic-probelm">
<h2>The basic probelm<a class="headerlink" href="#the-basic-probelm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We want to agree how to structure a repository, its storage strategy
and the basic unit(s) of what will be stored.  This model repository
will store &#8220;fragments&#8221; - chunks of HTML written by the user, a set of
fragments in a specific order are called a <em>binder</em>.  When arranged in
the order in the binder, the fragments will form a complete <em>end-document</em>
which can be viewed as HTML, or converted to PDF etc etc.</p>
<p>I have proposed we create a single flat namespace for all documents and resources
stored in (any) Connexions- Other- Repo, and navigae through it using Collections
that are versioned via md5 hashes.  It should be noted that I think the main issues
that were of concern to people are solvable (I think they are the branch-merge issue
and the definition of latest) - but I think that we should not try this now - scale back
focus on the simpler solution - google docs for a single server.</p>
<p>So stop talking and show an example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>org.cnx.frag:d3911c28-2a9e-4153-9546-f71d83e41126/e5df9b39e5b428a84341c100bfe260df
^^^                        ^^^^                    ^^^^
name of namespace          UUID in that namespace  md5 hash of current content

here we use org.cnx.frag as the namespace for a fragment.</pre>
</div>
<p>Or:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>org.cnx.frag:e5df9b39e5b428a84341c100bfe260df
^^^                   ^^^^
name of namespace     md5 hash of current content</pre>
</div>
<p>The short version of the long one I just threwaway:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="0">
<li>I think the concerns are<ul>
<li>what if two people in two repos work on the same document at the same time?
Which is latest?</li>
<li>What about &#8220;derive&#8221;.</li>
<li>surely we can track all this?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&#8220;Latest&#8221; : I <em>think</em> this is an attempt to allow me to follow
someone else&#8217;s chapter in my binder (Professor X is writing a
history of europe, I am writing book on Roman Emperors, I use his
chapter on Nero.)  I want to change his chapter, and I also want to
get his updates.  How do we handle this - well, if i want to make
changes I MUST derive.  That is there are now two documents.  So I
can have his chapter on Nero, but i can never get his updates
unless I never make changes.</li>
<li>Having external editors (outside of Connexions) be able to send
chapters in is the same as having two repos - that is we will
encounter a valid branched document at some point.  Our solutions
to Latest was to derive <em>before</em> changes were made.  So the derived
approach wont work here.  With two editors, or two repos, or
offline editing and uploading as a zip etc ...  we have two valid
documents, both from the same original doc, both holding valid
changes.  and both with the same &#8220;name&#8221;.  What do we do?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solutions : we need to solve branch-and-merge - that is offer a
convincing solution, or prevent it happening.  I suggest the latter.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Option 1 - wrap git-serve.</li>
<li>Option 2 - a combination of UUIDs and binders / history</li>
<li>Option 3 - extend the derive approach back to the new repo</li>
</ul>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Option 1 - we follow the growing DVCS trend and basically turn our</dt>
<dd>&#8220;namespace&#8221; into one big git namespace, and each repo, or
each workspace becomes its own git repo.  Its not bad but
the common case is likely to be I just write my book and
dont pull in chapters from others.  This is not as simple
as you want in git.</dd>
<dt>Option 2 - Distributed GoogleDocs style approach.  Label each file</dt>
<dd><p class="first">with a UUID.  This instantly enables external editors,
avoids reliance on central server(s) and the benefits of
decoupling.  But it does not solve branch-and-merge.  To do
that we need to version files - without central servers,
that means hashing the content.  So we <em>could</em> do that -
binders to represent the order, uuid/hash for each
fragment.  Its quite a nice solution.</p>
<p class="last">But it does not really solve branch-and-merge - Latest has
no sensible meaning</p>
</dd>
<dt>Option 3 - Single Server GoogleDocs - Label each file with UUID, version it</dt>
<dd>how you like.  But if you want to make a change you are either
in a race condition with anyone else with permissions or you are
&#8220;deriving&#8221; - and we dont do any merging or branching.</dd>
<dt>Option 4 - Distributed Single server - basically lock files before editing.</dt>
<dd>urgh. Across servers. urgh,urgh.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Simplest solution - Option 3.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Really simple Implementation - Still use UUIDs. Versioning is</dt>
<dd>irrelevant and does not need to be supported except
for freezing.  The namespace does not need to be
flat - we just store files in folders, which means
the module m3090 is actually stored under
collection400 Therefore versioning is not needed to
avoid naming collisions and Latest is always True.
A collection is a file strucutre - I suspect this
is what Phil meant with Zips.</dd>

<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I think Google Docs is offering an enticing solution - and they are not trying to
solve branch and merge either (afaik).  So we should not either, as it is a small
use case for now.</p>
<p>The filesystem based implementation does have the virtue of extreme simplicity.
And I have already implemented it!</p>
