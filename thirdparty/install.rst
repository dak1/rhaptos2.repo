TinyMCE

* md5sum: MD5 (tinymce_3.5b3_jquery.zip) = 2fd8f728fa9da4be42f7e0fffafe4cbd

We also need to load the supported JQuery plugin that enables us to integrate easily between mce and jquery.  If you download the above it is included, and available by::

    <!-- Load jQuery build -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/tiny_mce.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/jquery.tinymce.js"></script>
