===========================
Integrating OpenID Consumer
===========================


This is based heavily on the work from Flask-openid at::

 git clone https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-openid.git

This supplies a wrapper around the janrain python-openid

get_next_url
 request.values.get('next')
 so supply a next value in the request ...

Monkey pathching for now.
