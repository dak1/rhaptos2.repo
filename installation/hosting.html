<h1>A clever solution to the wrong problem<a class="headerlink" href="#a-clever-solution-to-the-wrong-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>I have completed a clever solution to a problem.  Unfortunately, its
probably the wrong problem.</p>
<p>The problem was fairly simple.  I had built a simple web services
demonstration, and then surrounded it with supporting services, like
logging, continuous builds, statsd/graphite servers.  All good,
eco-system like stuff.</p>
<p>And hosted on virtual servers on a private IP address space.</p>
<p>So, you had to be on my LAN in my office to view it. Since I was
working remotely, and was the only person actually in my office, this
was a bit of a problem.  In fact this is the <em>real</em> problem.</p>
<p>I could get you to tunnel in, VPN in, and see it but it seemed better
if I rebuilt the system over in your neck of the woods.  So initially
I set up the service on frozone.office.mikadosoftware.com, a rackspace
hosted server.  That worked, but there was only a web server and a
repository, no CI, no logging server, no messaging server.</p>
<p>So, I decided to recreate my LAN in your LAN, that way we can use one
location as the &#8216;most recent build&#8217; or the &#8216;beta&#8217; service.  But we
only had one physical host, and with only one routable IP <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>And, well, with some help, it worked.  I can now build a virtual,
NAT&#8217;d LAN inside a Linux host, which is pretty cool and has some
interesting, useful and cost-saving applications.</p>
<p>Its just that its still not on your LAN.  Its on another (virtual)
NAT&#8217;d LAN just like my office.  It took me a while to notice.  I was
wondering what that vague nagging feeling had been.</p>
<p>So, a comment Kathi made come back to me - they buy racksp[ace virtual
instances when they need a new server.</p>
<p>Well why don&#8217;t I just expand the one server I was using as a demo, but
three or more as I need.</p>
<p>And I did that.  And got oddly scared.  Not scared so much, more,
well, here are 3 hosts on the public internet, I am about to make one
a logging server, one a jenkins server.  How do I lock those down on
the <em>public</em> internet?</p>
<p>And then ...</p>
<p>This really will be developing in the open.</p>
<p>Release the code, test it in the open, build it on public servers.</p>
<p>I am a big advocate of DevOps - building the operational systems and
support at the same time as the &#8216;real&#8217; code, so that the solutions to
managing a system are baked-in deeply and naturally, not tacked on at
the last minute by harrased sysadmins.</p>
<p>Now, even so the final release to live is usually a big deal, security
issues come to the front, lots of performance testing, SecPen,
reworking and rethinking.</p>
<p>But what if all of that had already been done - built alongside the
apps themselves.</p>
<p>This asumptions that each server is on its own in a hostile
environment, is attractive to the idea we design complex systems in a
eco-system, and that they should be capable of surviving without the
DMZ.</p>
