This is the repository for cnx editor.
It is desinged to work primarily as a web app in conjunction with multiple other systems deployed 
using the bamboo setup files

It can be run from a single developer laptop, in a virtualenv.  

The install instructions for that are as follows::



to recap::

  deployment is dpoine using fabric files, usiong configuration written into global.ini

  before deployment, a staging process is run, basically sed-like, that sets the config for the environment we are in.  THis probably should move to ENV vars.


(this .txt version created solely to stop setup.py complaining.)
